#### Nouns, The Definite Article & Masculine and Feminine Endings

- A **noun** is a word used to talk about a person, place, thing.
- *En español* (In spanish), nouns are grouped into 2 "genders" (not a persons gender): **masculine** or **feminine**:

|                             | **Masculine**              | Feminine                    |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| *Por Ejemplo* (For Example) | The Boy - **El** chic**o** | The Girl - **La** chic**a** |

- In spanish, "the" is different depending on whether the word is masculine of feminine:

  - "**El**" is the typical word for "The" for masculine nouns. 
  - "**La**" is the typical word for "The" for feminine nouns.

- *El* and *La* are the **definite articles** for masculine and feminine nouns. They mean "the" when referring to a singular noun.

- Also, the typical ending for:

  - masculine words is "**-o**". 
  - feminine words is "**-a**"
  - These are the usual case; however there are many exceptions:

  | Gender    | Examples of common irregular endings |
  | --------- | ------------------------------------ |
  | Masculine |                                      |
  | Feminine  |                                      |

- The ending and article for all **living creatures**, however, can be predicted (it is their real gender!). *Por ejemplo*:

  - *El chico* (the male boy), *La chica* (the female girl)
  - *El gato* (the male cat), *La gata* (the female cat) 

- Note, that these refer to 1 boy or 1 girl. In order to refer to a group of boys, girls or people we need to use a different article (word for "The"):

  | *Gender* (Género)       | Singular         | Plural                         |
  | ----------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
  | *Masculine* (Masculino) | **el** chic**o** | **los** chic**os** - the boys  |
  | *Feminine* (Feminino)   | **la** chic**a** | **las** chic**as** - the girls |

  - What would be used for a mixed group of boys and girls?
    - The masculine plural since masculine is always used instead of feminine as masculine takes priority.

  # "Snazzy Phrases to commit to memory"
