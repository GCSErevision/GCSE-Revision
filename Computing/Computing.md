# Computing

## Architecture

### Computer System

A **computer system** uses a set of digital ***inputs***, ***processes them*** and creates a set of ***outputs*** using ***hardware*** (physical parts) and ***software***.

- Hardware is a physical part of a computer system.


- Inputs are provided by an **input device.** For example: Keyboard, Microphone, Touch Screen, Mouse...
- Outputs are provided by an **output device**. For example: Computer Monitor, Printer, Speakers...

##### Process

- The processing of data occurs in the **CPU** (Central Processing Unit) which is the "brain" of the computer.
  - It is also known as a **microprocessor**.


- The instructions in order to process the information are provided to the CPU by a **computer program**.
  - **Software** is a computer program that contains the set of instructions needed by the CPU in order to perform a specific task.

There are 2 main types of software:



## Data Representation

### Units
- A single **bit** is the smallest size of digital data and has only two values (Base-2): 0, 1.

- A **nibble** is a group of 4 bits.

- A **byte** contains 8 bits, for example 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 is a byte because it has 8 bits...
  - A single character requires 1 byte or 8 bits
