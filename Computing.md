# Computing

## Architecture

### Computer System

A **computer system** uses a set of digital *inputs*, *processes them* and creates a set of *outputs* using *hardware* and *software*.

The instructions in order to process the information are provided by a **program**.

## Data Representation

### Units
- A single **bit** is the smallest size of digital data and has only two values (Base-2): 0, 1.

- A **byte** contains 8 bits, for example 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 is a byte because it has 8 bits...
  - A single character requires 1 byte or 8 bits
