# Computing
## Architecture
### Computer System
A **Computer System** takes a set of digital inputs, processes them and creates a set of outputs. This is done by a combination of **hardware** and **software**.

- The Computer recieves inputs via an **input device** (e.g. keyboard, mouse...)

The processing of inputs occurs in the CPU (Central Processing Unit):
  - a single electronic chip within computer system.
  - microprocessor (_"brain"_)

The CPU uses a computer program which has instructions on how to process the inputs. **Software** is a computer program that contains the set of instructions needed by the CPU in order to perform a specific task.
