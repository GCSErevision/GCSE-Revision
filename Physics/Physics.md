## Energy
**Energy** is the amount of possible change in a **system.**

A **system** is an object or group of objects being studied.

### Energy Stores
When energy is transferred to an object, it is stored in one of the object's energy stores:

1. Thermal
2. Kinetic
3. Magnetic
4. Electrical
5. Nuclear
6. Elastic Potential
7. Gravitational Potential
8. Chemical (Potential)

Energy can be transferred:
- mechanically (a force doing work)
- electrically (work done by moving charges)
- heating
- radiation

When a system changes, energy is transferred:
- into or away from the system
- between different objects in the system
- between different types of energy stores

##### Closed & Open Systems
An **Open System** is when energy and matter can be transferred with the surrounding environment.

In a **closed system**, energy and matter cannot enter or leave. So the total amount of energy in a system must always be 0. This means that:

> â€‹	The total energy in a closed system must remain the same over time. This also means that energy and matter cannot be created or destroyed. 
>
> **The law of conservation of mass and energy.**

##### Work Done

Work done by a force causing a displacement can be calculated by:
