## Energy
**Energy** is the amount of possible change in a **system.**

A **system** is an object or group of objects being studied.

### Energy Stores
When energy is transferred to an object, it is stored in one of the object's energy stores:

1. Thermal
2. Kinetic
3. Magnetic
4. Electrical
5. Nuclear
6. Elastic Potential
7. Gravitational Potential
8. Chemical (Potential)

Energy can be transferred:
- mechanically (a force doing work)
- electrically (work done by moving charges)
- heating
- radiation

When a system changes, energy is transferred:
- into or away from the system
- between different objects in the system
- between different types of energy stores

##### Closed & Open Systems
An Open System is when energy and matter can be transferred with the surrounding environment.

In a closed system neither energy nor matter can enter or leave the system. So the net change in the total energy of the system must always be 0.

##### Work Done
**Work done** is the same as energy transferred.

Examples of work being done:
