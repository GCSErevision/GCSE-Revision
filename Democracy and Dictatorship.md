## Germany and the growth of democracy
### Kaiser Wilhelm II and the difficulties of ruling Germany
#### What was Germany like before WWI?
##### Unification of Germany
1. Before 1870s there were a collection of states with a similar language and culture in Europe.
2. Prussia, the largest and most powerful state, wanted to unite all of the states.
3. A series of battles were fought with France, Austria and Denmark but eventually Prussia won. The unification of Germany happened in 1871.
4. The King of Prussia became Kaiser (King of Germany).
##### How was Germany ruled?
Militarism was important to Prussia and became important to Germany. Prussian generals and soldiers formed most of the German army.

- Each state sent representatives (Bundesrat) to propose new laws to the Kaiser.
- Kaiser was supported by advisers/ministers and the chief minister was Chancellor (Prime Minister).
- There was a parliament (Reichstag), which was elected by all men over age of 25. The Reichstag discussed and voted on laws that the Kaiser and his ministers drew up.
- The Kaiser could choose to ignore the Reichstag and the Bundesrat if he wanted to. He also had the command of the military (including navy).

In 1888, Wilhelm II became Kaiser of Germany. He was related to the British royal family and wanted to make his nation as powerful and influential as the British Empire at the time. This led to industrialisation in Germany. By 1913, Germany was producing more iron and steel and as much coal as Britain. Also German companies were more renowned than all other European companies in electrical goods and chemicals industries.
##### Growth of socialism
Because of industrialisation, the upper class (factory owners, landowners, businessmen) were very rich and had a lot of influence with the Kaiser.

Many workers were unhapy because they still had low wages, poor working conditions and the price of food was rising. Working class people started to join trade unions and organise strikes in an attempt to force the Kaiser to improve their conditions.

Also, many working class people started voting for the Social Democratic Party (SPD) which believed in socialism - power and wealth should be shared equally among everyone. Some extreme socialists wanted a revolution against the Kaiser and the ruling class.
##### Foreign Policy
Weltpolitik - World Policy

Many European Empires (Britian, France, Portugal) had overseas colonies. Since the Kaiser wanted to transform Germany into a global superpower and have large colonies. He started to invade other countries in Africa to claim his own land for Germany.

1897, Reichstag debate on foreign policy:
> We wish to throw no-one into the shade, but we demand our place in the sun.

The Kaiser introduced new Naval Laws between 1898 and 1912 which rapidly increased their size. Taxes were raised and A LOT of money was borrowed for this. The Kaiser wanted a large navy because he (1) was militaristic, (2) wanted to take over new foreign territory and (3) defend existing territories.  
### Impact of the First World War
In August 1914, WW1 began when Germans and Austrians went to war against the French, British, Russians, Belgians and Serbs. Initially the war was popular among patriotic Germans. However...

##### Poverty
Germans soon started to suffer as the British used their large navy to form a blockade to stop supply ships getting to Germany. This led to immense shortages of food, medicine and clothing. As the war continued more and more people wanted to end it. In 1915, 500 women protested at German parliament buildings. The next year, 10,000 workers protested in Berlin shouting:
>"Down with the war, down with the government!"

By 1918, Germany was close to collapse. A lot of german people were surviving living on turnips and bread, and a flu epidemic was sweeping the country, killing thousands in Germany. Germany was also close to defeat on the battlefields.
##### Resignation of the Kaiser
General Ludendorff told German politicians they could never win the war in October 1918. He also advised the Kaiser that Germany would be treated more fairly if it became more democratic and the Kaiser transferred his powers to the people. The Kaiser transferred some of his power to the Reichstag and allowed a new government to be formed. However this was too little too late.

On 28 October 1918, the German navy was ordered out to sea from Kiel in northern Germany to attack the British naval blockade. Sailors refused to carry out the order. In ports nearby, other sailors started to refuse to folow orders. Workers in towns supported them.

Soldiers sent to deal with the protests joined in with the protesting sailors and workers. Towns and cities were taken over and councils were set up in cities such as Hamburg and Munich.

the Kaiser had lost support from even his army generals and he became worried about his safety in Germany. On 9 November 1918, he abdicated and secretly fled Germany.
##### End of the War
Friedrich Ebert, leader of the SPD; the largest political party, temporarily replaced the Kaiser. He promised to soon hold elections and on 11 November 1918 Germany surrendered; the end of WW1 (signed an armistice).
#### Impact of the war on Germany by 1918
- Germany had borrowed money from abroad to fund the war.
- Germany had also lent money to its allies and it was unlikely it would receive any payment back.
- 60,000 war widows and 2 million children without fathers.
- German factories had been used to create weapons instead of goods to sell in order to make money.
- **Germany was virtually bankrupt**
<br>
- Some factory owners made a lot more money during the war, while German workers had restrictions placed on their wages.
- Women worked in German factories during the war which outraged many Germans who thought this damaged tradition.
- **The war had divided German society further**
<br>
- Many ex-soldiers and civilians felt Germany could have won the war but had instead been betrayed by the politicians ("November criminals") who had surrendered on behalf of Germany.
- **Germany had become politically unstable**

#### Weimar Republic
After signing the Armistice, Ebert ordered: (1) improvements to working conditions, (2) help for the unemployed, (3) improved housing, (4) more food supplies. He also enforced freedom of speech and religion.

Ebert also declared that Germany would become a democratic republic - where ordinary Germans could choose their leaders by voting for them.

##### Sparticists and Free Corps
Spartacus League:
- Believed in **communism**
- Wanted Germany to be run by small councils of soldiers and workers.
- 6 January 1919 - Sparticists tried to take over Berlin.

Ebert responded by sending in a group of 2,000 ex-soldiers (**Free Corps**), to attack the Sparticists.

After 3 days of street fighting, Free Corps recaptured buildings and arrested and killed Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht - leaders of the Spartacus League.

Free Corps:
- hated Sparticists (and communists) because they blamed them for stirring up trouble in Germany near the end of the war which they believed was a major reason for Germany's defeat.
- Free Corps also ended some other communist uprisings brutally (Bavaria, Ruhr).

##### Communism
A form of society based on work by Karl Marx and others... They believed that:
- Everyone is equal; there are no different classes and no great differences in wealth.
- There is no private property and the government runs farms and businesses for the benefit of all people.
- There is little need for money or laws because everyone lives a simple life; sharing all they have with others.

There was a lot of fear in many European countries of communism because in 1917, Russian communists revolted against the ruling class and murdered the royal family.

#####

##### Weimar Republic is Born
In late January 1919, Ebert held the first election after WW1. the SPD (his own party) won. Ebert became the new German President. Due to violence in Berlin, the newly elected politicians met on 11 February 1919 in a German town called Weimar.

In this town, they drew up the **Weimar Consitution**, a formal set of rules for how Germany would be governed. This made Germany one of the most progressive and democratic societies in the world.
##### Structure of the political system in Weimar Republic
- All Germans had equal rights (including voting).
  - All women over 20 were allowed to vote

**The President (Head of State):**
- Elected every 7 Years
- Controlled military forces.
- Stay out of day-to-day running however had powers to act in times of crisis without having to get the support of the Reichstag by passing special emergency decrees (known as **Article 48**)

**The Chancellor (Prime Minister):**
- Chosen by the President (usually the leader of the party with the most political votes in the latest election)
- Responsible for day-to-day running of the country
- Required at least half of the Reichstag members to support a law in order to pass it.

**The Reichstag (Parliament):**
- Discussed and introduced Laws
- Members of the Reichstag (MPs) were elected every 4 years.
- The voting system used was proportional representation. This meant the number of votes made for a party decided exactly how many MPs they would have.

**The German People (Electorate):**
- All men and women over 20 could vote
- elected the President and politicians in the Reichstag
- constitution guaranteed them basic rights such as freedom of speech, religion...

But there were some problems:
- **Proportional representation** meant that lots of different political parties won seats at the Reichstag. This made it very difficult to pass a single law since it was hard to get a majority agreement. Between 1919 and 1933, no single political party ever won more than 50% of the votes. This also forced parties to work with other parties.
- A lot of the ruling class and older people hated the new system as they wanted the traditional system brought back. Also many people linked the current politicians to the end of the WW1 ("November Criminals").

##### Political Parties at the start of Weimar Germany:
Political Party  | Communist Party (KPD)  | Social Democratic Party (SPD)  | German Democratic Party (DDP)  | Centre Party (Zentrum)  | People's Party (DVP)  | National People's Party (DNVP)  | National Socialist German Worker's Party (NSDAP or Nazis)  
--|---|---|---|---|---|---|--

##### 1923: The Weimar Republic in trouble

#### Treaty of Versailles
1. Winning Countries (France, Britain, USA) met after WWI at Versailles Palace, France to decided penalties against the losing countries.
2. In March 1919 Treaty was signed which listed punishments against Germany.

Main Points of the treaty:
- Germany must accept entire responsibilty for the war.
- must pay reparations (cost of war) (£6.6 billion paid by 1988.).
- army restricted to 100,000 soldiers, 6 battle ships, no submarines, tanks or airforce.
- all colonies must be handed over to other countries.
- Larges areas of Germany split up to form smaller countries (e.g. Poland, Chzechoslovakia...)
- Germany must never unite with Austria
- German soldiers banned from entering Rhineland (area next to France).

German government was not invited to the discussions. Treaty was signed by germany 28 June 1919.
##### German reactions to the treaty
1. Too harsh. Would cripple German economy and make many homeless and in poverty.
2. They felt humiliated and angry with the way their country had been treated.
3. hated the fact the treaty had been dictated to them - "diktat" (dictated peace).
4. Many Germans felt betrayed by their government for (1) surrendering when many believed they could have won ("November Criminals") and (2) signed the dictated peace without fighting for a better treaty.

Field Marshall Hindenburg:
> "The German army was stabbed in the back. No blame is to be attached to the army. It is perfectly clear on whom the blame rests."

Adolf Hitler:
> "Each point of that treaty could have been engraved on the minds and hearts of the German people and burned into them until sixty million men and women would find their souls aflame with a feeling of rage and shame."
