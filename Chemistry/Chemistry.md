##### What is matter?

Matter is anything that occupies space and has mass.

### Atomic Structure

**Atoms** are the fundamental unit of matter.

Atoms have a radius of 0.1nm.

The Nucleus:
- Very small centre of atom (radius 1/10,000 of that of the atom)
- Contains protons (+, 1) and neutrons (0, 1)
- Where most of the mass is concentrated

Electron Shells:
- Electrons (-, 1/2000) orbit around nucleus in shells
- The volume of their orbits determines the size of the atom.
- The most inner electron shell that is incompleted is filled first. Then, the next:
  - The 1st electron shell requires 2 electrons to be filled.
  - The 2nd electron shell requires 8 electrons to be filled.
  - The 3rd electron shell requires 8 electrons to be filled.

Atoms have no net overall charge - there is balance in the force. This means that:

$$ \text{number of electrons = number of protons} $$

A substance that is made up of one type of atom with the same number of protons is an **element**.

There are slightly more than 100 elements.

Each element has a symbol that is arranged to form the **periodic table.**

##### Introduction to chemical equations

$$ \text{reactants} \rightarrow \text{products} $$

chemical reactions show the initial substances and what they turn into.

*word equations:* $$ \text{hydrogen + oxygen} \rightarrow \text{water} $$

*symbol equations* help you to: 

- see how much of each element is in each substance 

- how much of each substance is in the reaction: 

  $$ 2\text{H}_2 + O_2 \rightarrow 2\text{H}_2\text{O}  $$

> The total mass of the products formed must always be the same as the total mass of the reactants.
>
> **- Law of conservation of mass**
>
> *This means that all symbol equations must be balanced (the same amount on each side)*

*State symbols* are added to balanced symbol equations to show the state of matter of that substance: $$ \text{(s) means solid} \\  \text{(l) means liquid} \\ \text{(g) means gas} \\ \text{(aq) means substance dissolved in aqueous solution}$$

- An **aqueous solution** means water solution (think of aquaman!)

#### History of the Atom

Ancient Greeks were first to have ideas about particles and atoms.

In the early 1800s John Dalton conducted experiments that suggested substances were made up of tiny, hard spheres that could not be broken up. Each element was made up of atoms with a certain amount of mass. He also suggested that during chemical reactions atoms rearranged themselves and combined with different atoms to form new substances (products).

At the end of the 1800s J. J. Thomson discovered the electron. Thomson found this by:

- applying high voltages to gases at pressure.
- he found that beams of particles were attracted to a positive charge; meaning that they must be negatively charged.

This meant that John Dalton's model of the atom was wrong; they could be broken up and they must have positive and negatively charged particles.

J.J Thomson invented the "Plum Pudding Model" for the atom:

- a sphere of positive charge
- negatively charged particles (electrons) in sphere.

About 10 years later, Ernest Rutherford designed an experiment to test the "Plum Pudding Model". It was called the "Alpha Particle Scattering Experiment" and was carried out by Geiger and Marsden:

- A beam of alpha particles was aimed at very thin gold foil. Each time they passed through the gold foil they were detected.
- Based on the Plum Pudding Model, the alpha particles were expected to pass straight through the foil.
- However, this did not happen. Instead, some of the alpha particles were repelled and deflected straight back or at an angle. 
- They realized that the alpha particles were being reflected by a tiny concentration of positive charge in the center of the atom: The Nucleus.

This experiment removed the "Plum Pudding Model" and instead the "Nuclear Model" was now used by scientists to explain the atom.

In 1914, Niels Bohr noticed that light emitted when atoms were heated had specific amounts of energy. He suggested that:

- electrons must be orbiting the nucleus at set distances, in certain fixed energy levels.
- Energy must be given out when electrons fall from a higher to a lower energy level.

James Chadwick discovered the neutron in 1932.



### The Periodic Table

All known chemical elements are placed in the order of the number of protons that each of their atoms contain (atomic number).

This arranges elements so they are in groups (vertical columns) and periods (rows).

**Groups** on the periodic table contain elements with similar properties

The $$\text{group number = number of electrons in outer shell} \\ \text{(group 0 = full outer shell)}$$

**Rows** show the number of filled electron shells. 

#### History of the Periodic Table

Scientists in the 19th century tried to find patterns in the behavior of elements in order to understand more about chemistry. 

John Dalton arranged elements in order of their "atomic weight".

In 1864, John Newland arranged elements in order of their mass but noticed properties of every eight elements seemed similar. So he made a new column every 8 elements:

- This was known as "The Law of Octaves".
- He arranged these based on all the currently known elements (not the ones still to come)
- Other scientists ridiculed him and refused his ideas.

##### Dmitri Mendeleev

In 1869, Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev:

- arranged atoms in order of their atomic weight. 
- arranged them in a regularly occurring pattern to group similar elements by properties together.
- left gaps between elements with similar properties and other elements which allowed him to predict properties of elements to come in the future.
  - His ideas were proved after he predicted the properties of elements which were discovered a few years later.
- modified the order where appropriate to fit with the properties of elements:
  - E.g: Argon, Pottasium.

#### Metals and Non-metals

| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Appearance                 | Shiny                                    | Dull (but may be colorful)               |
| Properties                 | **Ductile** (drawn into wires) <br />**Malleable** (can be made into very ) | **Brittle**                              |
| State at room temperature  | Solid (except Mercury)                   | Liquid, Gas                              |
| Melting and Boiling Point  | Higher                                   | Lower                                    |
| Ions formed                | **Cation** (positive ion)                | **Anion** (negative ion)                 |
| Conductors?                | good conductors of heat and electricity  | poor conductors of heat and electricity. (insulators) |
| Location on Periodic Table | Found on the left of the staircase       | Found on the right of the staircase      |

  **Metalloids** are found next to the staircase on either side. They have some properties of a metal and some properties of a non-metal. For example:

- Silicon, Germanium

#### Atomic Number & Mass Number

The atomic number is the smallest (or lowest down) number:
$$\text{atomic number = number of protons}$$

The mass number is the larger number (or highest up):
$$ \text{mass number = number of protons + number of neutrons} $$

So, isotopes have the same number of neutrons but a different number of 

Therefore, the number of neutrons can be found by:
$$ \text{mass number - atomic number = number of neutrons} $$

#### Ions, Atoms, Isotopes & Relative Atomic Mass

An **ion** is a charged atom or group of atoms:

- A positive ion is called a **cation** and happens when atoms lose electrons. This is because:

  $$ \text{number of protons > number of electrons} \therefore{\\\text{positive charge > negative charge}} $$

- A negative ion is called an **anion** and happens when atoms gain electrons.

- To find the charge of an ion work out the number of protons minus the number of electrons. E.g. Lithium has atomic number = 3 and mass number = 7 and loses one electron:

  $$ \text{number of electrons = number of protons = 3 - 1 = 2}  \\ \text{net charge = number of protons - number of electrons}  \\ \text{net charge = 3 - 2 = +1} $$

Ions are formed because atoms want to lose or gain electrons to have a full outer shell:

- Metals form **cations** because they lose electrons since it is easier for them to lose electrons to fill an outer shell than gain them.

Atoms of the same element have the same number of protons. BUT, they can have different numbers of neutrons. These are called **isotopes**:

- Sometimes isotopes have an unstable number of neutrons in there nucleus so are radioactive.
- Different isotopes of the same element have different physical properties but the same chemical properties.


- They all have same atomic number but different mass numbers.

So what atomic mass number is used on the periodic table for an element?

- A weighted average of all the isotopes of that element that factors in:
  - how common an isotope is (isotope abundance)
  - the isotopes atomic mass number (isotope mass number)

$$ \text{Relative Atomic Mass (Ar) =} \frac{\sum \text{(isotope mass number * isotope abundance)}}{\text{total isotope abundance}} $$

$$\sum$$ means that you follow the process for all isotopes.

#### Group 0 - Noble Gases

- filled outer shell of electrons
  - This makes them very unreactive since they are naturally stable so don't need to react to gain / lose electrons - they are **inert** (very unreactive).
    - This also means they are **non-flammable** (won't set on fire easily).
  - This is also the reason they exist as single atoms; **monatomic**.
- All are colourless gases at room temperature.




As you go down the group (and relative atomic mass and proton number increases):

- Boiling point increases:
  - This is because of an increase in the number of electrons in each atom leading to
  - greater intermolecular forces between them which need to be overcome.

#### Group 1 - Alkali Metals

- 1 electron in their outer shell
