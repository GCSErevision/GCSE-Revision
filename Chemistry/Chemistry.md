## Atoms, bonding and moles
### Atomic Structure

**Atoms** are the fundamental unit of matter.

Atoms have a radius of 0.1nm.

The Nucleus:
- Very small centre of atom
- Contains protons (+, 1) and neutrons (0, 1)
- Where most of the mass is concentrated

Electron Shells:
- Electrons (-, 1/2000) orbit around nucleus in shells
- The volume of their orbits determines the size of the atom.
- The most inner electron shell that is incompleted is filled first. Then, the next:
  - The 1st electron shell requires 2 electrons to be filled.
  - The 2nd electron shell requires 8 electrons to be filled.
  - The 3rd electron shell requires 8 electrons to be filled.

Atoms have no net overall charge - there is balance in the force. This means that:

number of electrons = number of protons

A substance that is made up of one type of atom with the same number of protons is an **element**.

**Isotopes** are different forms of atoms of the same element. They have the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons.

There are slightly more than 100 elements.

Each element has a symbol that is arranged to form the **periodic table.**

### The Periodic Table

- Chemical elements are placed in the order of their atomic (proton) number.

  - This arranges elements so they are in groups (vertical columns) and periods (rows).

- **Groups** on the periodic table contain elements with similar properties

- The $$\text{group number = number of electrons in outer shell}$$

- **Rows** show the number of filled electron shells. 

#### Metals and Non-metals

| Ions formed                | **Cation** (positive ion)                | **Anion** (negative ion)                 |
| Conductors?                | good conductors of heat and electricity  | poor conductors of heat and electricity. (insulators) |

#### Atomic Number, Mass Number & Relative Atomic Mass
The atomic number is the smallest (or lowest down) number:
$$\text{atomic number = number of protons}$$

The mass number is the larger number (or highest up):
$$ \text{mass number = number of protons + number of neutrons} $$

So, isotopes have the same number of neutrons but a different number of 

Therefore, the number of neutrons can be found by:
$$ \text{mass number - atomic number = number of neutrons} $$

Because of isotopes, you must take a weighted average:
$$ \text{Relative Atomic Mass (Ar) =} \frac{\sum \text{(isotope mass number * isotope abundance)}}{\text{total isotope abundance}} $$
