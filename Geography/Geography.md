## The Physical Environment
### UK Landscapes
#### Rock Types
<br>  | Sedimentary  | Metamorphic  | Igneous  
--|---|---|--
Formation  | Small particles that have been eroded, transported and deposited in layers OR from the remains of dead animals and plants  | Other rocks that are subjected to extreme pressure and or heat.  |  Created by volcanic activity; when magma or lava cools.
Hardness  | Soft  | Very Hard  | Hard
Examples  | Sandstone, limestone, chalk  | slate, marble  | granite, basalt  

##### Role of Plate tectonics on  UK Landscapes
1. Millions of years ago, Britain was closer to plate boundaries.
  a. more active volcanoes and plate movements
2. Plate movements caused folds and faults in rocks.
##### Role of Geology on UK Landscapes
Upland Landscapes are formed of harder rock because they are more resistant erosion and have been eroded less than lowland landscapes.

Lowland landscapes are formed of softer rock because they erode faster.

##### Distribution of Rock Types around UK

#### Human Activity on North and South Downs
##### Agriculture
- 85% of the National Park is farmed, with approximatley 1100 farming businesses operating.
- Chalk grassland used for grazing of sheep and training racehorses because grass is short and rich in nutrients.
- south-facing lower slopes of South Downs have deeper soils which are used for more arable farming; wheat, barley & vine cultivation.

Pros  | Cons  
--|--
income generated from farming supports local economy  | Decline in arable farming and changes in farming practices have reduced presence of arable plants, which has damaged wildlife habitats.  
Arable farming supports rare bird species  | significant decline in chalk grassland due to chemicals used in farming  
hedgerows and field margins have created wildlife corridors for bats  | decline of traditional farming has led to scrub encroachment on the remaining chalk grassland.  

##### Forestry

- mix of decideous and coniferous woodland
- covers 20% of the park (mainly in western half)

Pros  | Cons
--|--
ancient trees, provide habitats for a diverse range of wildlife  | The removal of woodland for new developments is threatening some of the ancient large-leaved lime woodland.   
Timber harvested is a valuable sustainable product.  | Many of the hazel and chestnut coppices are under threat, because people no longer manage them in the traditional way. As they become overgrown, the quality of the woodland and biodiversity declines.  

##### Settlements
- chalk escarpments were suitable for development of spring-line settlements. Settlements were built on south slopes which provided shelter due to the naturally formed slope.
- 120,000 people live in South Downs National Park.
- Mainly rural but surrounded by towns and cities
- Recently, there have been new developments which have not always used traditional design or local building materials. This has led to a loss of distinctiveness.
- Many historical features (such as wooden signage for roads) have been replaced.

### Coastal Landscapes and Processes
The **coastline** is where the land meets the sea. The UK coastline is diverse in landscape due to different physical processes and impacts of human activities.

The coast works as a naturally interconnected and balanced system. Erosion in one place leads to transport and deposition of sediments in another.
##### Marine processes at the coast
Process  | Delete column  | Explanation
--|---|--
Hydraulic action  | Marine  | <ol><li>when waves crash against the cliff, the impact, force and weight of the water against the rocks wears away the rocks. </li><li>compresses air in joints and faults in the rock, causing pressure to build and loose rocks to become dislodged.</li><li>As the waves retreat, the compressed air is released, often explosively, causing the rock to weaken further.</li></ol>
Abrasion  | Marine  | <ol><li>fragments of rock, pebbles and sand are picked up by the waves and flung against the face of the cliff</li><li>This results in fragments of rocks breaking off.</li></ol>  
Solution  | Marine  | Chemical action of sea water on rocks. <br><br> Most effective on limestone (calcium is dissolved and carried away by seawater)
Attrition  | Marine  | <ol><li>rock fragments and pebbles carried by waves</li><li>are reduced in size as they collide against each other and the cliff face.</li><li>they are eventually broken down into sand-sized particles, which are more easily transported by waves.</li></ol>  

##### Land processes at the coast
**Weathering** is the break down of rocks at or near the surface of the ground.

Weathering processes that affect rocks exposed at the coast:

Process  | Explanation  
--|--
Mechanical (Freeze thaw)  |  <ol><li>when water freezes in a crack or hole in a rock, it expands by 10%, causing stresses within the rock.</li><li>When it then melts water seeps deeper into the rock along the crack.</li><li>After repeated cycles of freezing and thawing, fragments of rock eventually break off.</li></ol>
Chemical (acid rain)  | <ol><li>When rain falls on rocks such as limestone and chalk a weak chemical reaction takes place</li><li>since rainwater is slightly acidic.</li><li>This results in the rock weakening and breaking down.</li></ol>  
Biological  | <ul><li>the roots of growing plants can widen cracks in rocks.</li><li>Burrowing animals and nesting birds on cliff faces can also cause the rock to weaken and decay.</li></ul>  

**Mass movement** is the downslope movement of rocks and soil from the cliff under the influence of gravity.

Process  | When does it occur? | Explanation   
--|---|--
Rock falls  | rock at the base of the cliff has been undercut by waves  | The rocks above are left unsupported which causes it to collapse. Pieces of rock fall from a weathered cliff suddenly.
Slumping  | after long periods of rainfall  | <ol><li>rain seeps through permeable rocks (e.g. sandstone)</li><li>Where the permeable rock meets an impermeable rock (e.g. clay)</li><li>the saturated soil and weaker rock slumps and slides in a rotational manner along a curved surface.</li></ol>  
Sliding  | (similar to slumping) bedding plane (flat) instead of curved surface  | Large amounts of soil and rock move downslope rapidly and can cause a lot of damage.  

##### Transportation & Deposition
The eroded material will be transported along the coastline by different processes depending on:
1. size of the material
2. amount of energy in waves

_methods of transport are the same as those in the river channel..._

**Deposition** occurs when there is not enough energy to carry the eroded material any further.
#### waves and geology on the coastal landscape
##### Waves
**Waves** are made by wind blowing over the sea. Friction on the surface of the water causes ripples to form, which grow into waves.

The amount of energy (and strength / ability to erode) of a wave is determined by:
- wind strength (or speed)
- wind duration
- fetch; distance of open water wind has been blowing over.

As a wave approaches the shore, the base of the wave is slowed by friction with the seabed, but the upper part continues to travel forward. Eventually the top of the wave topples over and hits the cliff or beach..

**swash** - the water that surges up the beach until it runs out of energy. The water then runs back down the beach under the influence of gravity - **backwash**.
##### Types of Wave
<br>  | Destructive  | Constructive
--|---|--
formed by?  | strong winds blown over large fetch areas  | light winds
ability to erode  | powerful, coastal erosion  | do not erode, encourage deposition  
break frequency  | break frequently between 11-15 per minute |   less frequently; 6-9 wave breaks per minute
characteristics  | tall, steep, closely spaced  | low in height, widely spaced; breaking gently.
strength of swash and backwash  | backwash > swash (so pebbles are carried out to sea)  |  swash > backwash (more material carried up the beach than out to sea)
types of beaches formed  | steep and narrow  |  wide and shallow
protection provided to cliffs?  | little in the way of protection (cannot absorb much of the wave energy)  | help to protect cliffs (wave energy absorbed by the beach)  

**Destructive waves**
![Destructive Waves](http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/8d4062a22a73715eb6abc6e21c88bbbba5eebf8c.gif)
**Constructive waves**
![Constructive Waves](http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/903cb89096e5824a7b28b5172135498d5bc2a193.gif)
##### Disconcordant and Concordant coasts
<br>  | Disconcordant  | Concordant  
--|---|--
bands of resistant and less resistant rocks run... to the coast  | RIGHT ANGLES  | PARALLEL
rocks erode at...  | varying rates (due to different rock hardnesses)  | similar rates (same rock type)
this forms...  | **headlands** (sections of rock more resistant that stand out) and **bays** (sections of rock less resistant that retreat into land further) |  less headlands and bays. More resistant rocks form high and steep cliffs. If the harder rock is breached, sea able to erode softer rock behind. This creates a **cove** (circular area of water with a narrow entrance from the sea)

##### Coastal landforms
- Cliffs are most widespread landforms of coastal erosion.

**Formation of wave cut platform:**
1. destructive waves attack bottom of the rock face; between high and low water marks. Forming a **wave cut notch**.
2. Notch gets deeper and overhanging cliff above becomes increasingly unsupported and eventually collapses.
3. Waves remove rock debris and begin to erode and undercut the new cliff face.
4. through a cycle of wave erosion and cliff collapse, the cliff face and coastline gradually retreat inland.
5. A gently sloping rocky area is left at the bottom of the retreating cliff. This is a **wave cut platform:**
	- platform covered at high tide but exposed at low tide.
	- rough surface because of differences in rock structure picked out by abrasion to create many grooves, rock pools and ridges within the bare rock.

**Formation of caves, arches, stacks and stumps:**
1. Destructive waves break against the headland, any lines of weakness in the rock such as joints or faults are attacked.
2. Through hydraulic action and abrasion waves erode the rock alkong the joint or fault which will increase in size and eventually form a **cave**.
3. Waves continue to erode the cave (mainly via hydraulic action).
4. Wave breaks block entrance to cave and traps air within. Air is compressed, increasing the pressure within the cave. If the cave forms part of a narrow headland, the pressure may cause back of cave to be pushed through to the other side. This then forms an **arch** (cave open on both sides.)
5. More erosion occurs and widens the arch.
6. Sea undercuts base of the arch placing more pressure on top part of arch.
7. Weakened roof of the arch collapses, leaving a **stack** (pinnacle of rock separated from mainland).
8. Further erosion and weathering may cause stack to collapse to leave a small, flat **stump**, often covered by the sea at high tide.

##### Landforms of coastal Deposition
**Longshore drift** is the process of transportation which moves sand and pebbles along the coast:

1. Waves approach coast at an angle.
2. Swash carries sand and pebbles up the beach at the same angle as the wave.
3. Backwash draws sediment back down the beach at right angles to the coastline, as it is the steepest gradient.
4. process is repeated along coastline resulting in a zigzag movement of sediment along the coast.
5. The direction of LSD is controlled by the direction of the prevailing wind.

**Beaches** are formed when eroded material is transported by longshore drift and deposited by constructive waves along the coastline:
Type of beach:  | sandy  | pebble
--|---|--
Found?  | sheltered bays (bay head beaches)  | <ul><li>where cliffs are being eroded</li><li>where there are high-energy waves</li></ul>  
Gradient?  | gentle  | steep
Wide/Narrow?  | Wider  | Narrower

##### Profile of beach
- The profile (cross-section) of beach is rarely smooth.

1. At the top end, beaches may include a **storm beach** made up of boulders and shingle deposited by the largest waves during storm conditions.
2. Below, a ridge of shingle and sand (a **berm**), marks the normal high tide.
	- a series of berms can be left by a retreating tide.
3. The smallest material (sand) is deposited near the sea.

##### Spits
**Spit** is a long, narrow ridge of sand or shingle, one end of which is attached to the land while the other end projects out to sea:
- if spit is formed of sand, sand dunes are usually found at back of it.
- area behind spit is sheltered, leading to deposition of silt and mud and the creation of a **saltmarsh**.

**Formation of a spit**
1. Material transported along the coast by LSD and deposited where there is a bend in the coastline or a river's mouth.
2. More and more sediment is deposited, forming a ridge that extends into the sea.
3. As ridge extends into open water, tip is affected by wind and waves approaching from different directions. This causes the end of the spit to curve.

##### Bars
A **bar** is a ridge of sand or shingle across the entrance to the bay or river mouth. Fresh water is trapped behind it to form a **lagoon**.

**Formation:**
1. Material transported (by LSD) and deposited at a bend in the coast or river mouth.
2. Deposition continues in a line across entrance to the bay or river mouth, trapping fresh water behind forming a bar and lagoon.

#### Causes and effects of coastal erosion
**Coastal erosion** is the removal of material from the coast by wave action.
##### How fast is the UK coast changing?
Some parts of the UK are eroding at a faster rate than others.

- Across England and Wales about 28% of the coastline erodes at a faster rate than 10cm a year.

- The rate of erosion is unequal; a lot of erosion can happen at once from a sudden landslip or after a great storm.

- Rates of erosion are expected to increase by 2080 because of (1) rising sea levels and (2) increasing storms, brought about by **climate change**.

##### Rising sea level
- Sea level along the English Channel has risen by about 12cm in the past 100 years.
- Levels are expected to rise by 11-16m by 2030 due to **global warming**:
	1. a warmer climate causes seawater to expand and also causes the ice sheets and glaciers to melt, leading to increased sea levels as a result.
	2. Cliffs are currently being undercut and collapsing will continue to retreat; the position of the wave cut notch and the level of the wave cut platform may change.
	3. Areas of "soft" coastline (clays and gravel) may experience more erosion and retreat due to more frequent and stronger storms.

##### Storms and storm surge
A **storm surge** is a large-scale increase in sea level (up to 3 metres) as gale-foprce winds drive water towards the coastline:
- can last from hours - days, span 100s of kilometres and cause significant damage and loss of life.

- North Sea storm surge of 1953 was one of the worst natural disasters to hit UK:
	- lasted 2 days
	- flood defences were breached; coastal towns in Lincolnshire, East Anglia and Kent devastated (seawater rushing through streets).
- Another major North Sea storm surge occurred 2013 December:
	- same time as highest tides of the year
	- coastal defences, early warnings; flood-related deaths and major damage was avoided.
- January and February 2014; sequence of very deep depressions driven by **jet stream** towards UK along with very high winds:
	- widespread damage; floading along south coast.


##### Human causes and impacts of coastal erosion
Cause  | Impact  | Notes  
--|---|--
Structures like groynes built to trap sand  | increased erosion further along the coast  |  
**Dredging** (removes sand and gravel)  | increased erosion further along the coast  |  
Protecting cliffs from erosion  | increased erosion further along the coast  |  
##### Managing coastal erosion and flood risk
- Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) is responsible for protection of the coastline from flooding and erosion in England and Wales.

- **Shoreline Management Plans (SMPs)** are made by them to:
	- reduce threat of flooding and erosion to people and the environment
	- benefit the environment, society and economy (**sustainable development**)

- SMP potential policies:
	1. _No intervention_
	2. _Hold the line_ (maintain existing shoreline by investing in defences)
	3. _Managed realignment_ (allow shoreline to change naturally but manage and control process)
	4. _Advance the line_ (build new defences on seaward side)
	- Most of the time _Hold the line_ strategy is used. There are 2 main strategies to do this: **soft engineering** and **hard engineering**.

**Soft engineering** - more natural approach using the environment.
**Hard engineering** - artificial defences made from concrete.

##### Examples of hard and soft engineering:
Technique  | Type  | Explanation  | Pros  | Cons  
--|---|---|---|--
Beach nourishment (recharge)  | Soft  | sand/shingle added to a beach to make it wider and or higher  | <ul><li>beach can absorb more wave energy</li></ul>  |  <ul><li>Requires constant maintenance which is expensive</li></ul>
Sand dune regeneration  | Soft  | grass, bushes and trees are planted to stabilise sand dunes  | <ul><li>Helps dunes to develop; maintaining a natural coastal environment and encouraging tourism and wildlife.</li></ul>  | <ul><li>Areas of the beach have to be fenced off; prohibiting access.</li></ul>  
Sea walls  | Hard  | <ul><li>concrete walls; 3-5 metres high.</li><li>built at foot of cliffs/top of a beach</li><li>(sometimes curved to reflect waves back out to sea)</li></ul>  | <ul><li>very effective at stopping the sea.</li></ul>  | <ul><li>obtrusive and unnatrual to look at</li></ul>
Groynes  | Hard  | wooden/rock structures built along the beach at right angles  | <ul><li>quick to construct</li></ul>  | <ul><li>interrupting LSD causes an impact further along coast</li></ul>  
Rip rap (rock armour)  | Hard  | large boulders piled at the foot of the cliff or the top of the beach  | <ul><li></li></ul>  | <ul><li></li></ul>

#### **Case study: Dawlish Warren Sand Spit**

**Dawlish Warren** is a seaside resort on south coast of Devon.

**Spit**:
- extends about 2km north-eastwards; protecting the Exe estuary from the open sea.
- designated Local Natural Reserve in 1978 and National Natural Reserve in 2000.
- provides a unique habitat for a range of coastal species (birds, flowering plants, wading birds, wildfowl)
- Mussels are harvested in the calm waters behind the spit (fishing industry)
- popular tourist resort (480,000 visitors a year):
	- wide range of public transport (trains, busses, ferries, paths) provide access to beach.
- number of small businesses and residential properties (13% of employment is seaside tourism)
- Exe Estuary popular for water-based recreational activities.

##### Physical factors changing spit
1. originally formed 7000 years ago; 2 sand spits: Outer Warren and Inner Warren - separated by Greenland Lake.
2. By 1930s, erosion had caused 2 spits to join; enclosing the lake and forming single spit.
3. Spit continues to change due to deposition and erosion processes; High spring tides with strong winds (storm surges) have driven waves across the ridge that forms the spit's southern and eastern extents. Erosion of beach and dunes has caused the spit to retreat.
4. 2013-14 storms; 5 metres of sand lost from southern face of sand dunes. Sand has been transported and deposited on the eastern side.

##### Human factors changing spit

- 1930s bungalows built on eastern side of spit; washed away 1940s.
- First sea defence 1917, western end (protecting railway line); Granite boulder rip rap.
- After 1940s, British rail added sleeper barriers at foot of the dunes and planted trees to help stabilise them.
- Wooden groynes on beach 1959.
- 1960s storms continued to erode dunes.
- New coastal defences installed 1970s:
	- 300 metre long concrete sea wall next to existing rip rap revetment, with promenade on top.
	- 300 metre rock-filled wire baskets beneath sand dunes to hold them in place.
	- 18 groynes to stabilise beach levels.
- After storms in 1989 and 1990, the western end of the spit was repaired with 35,000 tonnes of granite imported from Norway and deposited at foot of sea wall.

##### Protecting sand spit into the future: Shoreline Management Plan
- After storms in 2013/14, the Environment Agency proposed a range of works that are needed at Dawlish Warren to maintain the spit: ("Hold the line" plan):
	- beach renourishment (recharge)
	- maintaining sea wall and rip rap on western end of spit (near to tourist facilities and residential properties)
	- repairing, replacing and extending wooden groynes along beach
	- building new flood defences near visitor centre to reduce risk of tidal flooding to Dawlish Warren
	- removing rock-filled wire baskets (gabions) to allow sand dunes to follow a more natural alignment.
- £14 million scheme
- reduce risk of flooding to 2900 properties
- protect main railway line

**Concerns and responses:**
Concern  | response  
--|--
prioritizing habitats over people  | legal requirement to replace lost habitats.  
costs a lot of money  | cost of not doing anything is greater  
Farmers will have to give up land in order to provide room for new habitats  | landowners must agree and will recieve financial compensation  
Protect beach will worsen flooding in other locations  | infrastructure is prioritized  

- sea wall and groynes may cause **coastal squeeze** where coastal habitats (saltmarshes) are prevented from moving inland in response to storms or rising sea level, so become smaller over time. This forces compensatory habitats to be made elsewhere.

Defences cannot defend against severe storms or natural events that haven't been factored into the defence schemes. Strategies for preparing for these events:
- electrical sockets installed higher on walls
- solid floors to make cleaning up easier
- a good communication network to provide ample warning time in event of a flood.
- community training on:
	1. how to prepare for a flood properly
	2. what to do when a flood occurs
	3. what do after a flood has happened.
