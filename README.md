# The Unorthodox Textbook

GCSE's are boring, dull and outdated[^62e6521e]. These series of textbooks hope to make passing them:
1. Easier.
2. A more interesting/pleasant experience.
3. A better setup for future studies (A levels...)

Unique features of these textbooks:
1. 100% free.
2. Accompanied by question books (which contain real past paper questions).
3. Filled with references to interesting videos, websites and wikipedia articles to broaden your knowledge of what you are studying.
4. A LOT of hyperlinks! These help to link your knowledge of 1 similar thing to another similar thing. This greatly helps to make what you learn relevant and useful.
5. A lot of bullet points and lists are used to try and condense content rather than having one paragraph after another. Tables are also used A LOT to help compare similar points or parts.
6. The writing is designed to try and be understandable to the average GCSE student rather than the jargon-filled textbooks.
7. These textbooks can be easily downloaded and personalized for your own study. They are also regularly updated and improved.
8. Filled with pictures!
