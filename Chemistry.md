## Atoms, bonding and moles
### Atomic Structure
**Atoms** are the fundamental unit of matter.

Atoms have a radius of 0.1nm.

The Nucleus:
- Very small centre of atom
- Contains protons (+, 1) and neutrons (0, 1)
- Where most of the mass is concentrated

Electron Shells:
- Electrons (-, 1/2000) orbit around nucleus in Shells
- The volume of their orbits determines the size of the atom.

Atoms have no net overall charge - there is balance in the force. This means that:

number of electrons = number of protons

A substance that is made up of one type of atom with the same number of protons is an **element**.

**Isotopes** are different forms of the same element. They have the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons.

There are slightly more than 100 elements.

Each element has a symbol that is shown on the periodic table.
#### The Periodic Table
The atomic number is the smallest (or lowest down) number:
$$\text{atomic number = number of protons}$$

The mass number is the larger number (or highest up):
$$ \text{mass number = number of protons + number of neutrons} $$

Therefore, the number of neutrons can be found by:
$$ \text{mass number - atomic number = number of neutrons} $$

Because of isotopes, you must take a weighted average:
$$ \text{Relative Atomic Mass (Ar) =} \frac{\sum \text{isotope mass number * isotope abundance}}{\text{total isotope abundance}} $$
